## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Test on actual 14" laptop (1366x768 or 1440x900)
   - Check for horizontal scrolling at each breakpoint
   - Verify all interactive elements are accessible

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Use the responsive-test.js script created
   - Check multiple viewports programmatically
   - Take screenshots for visual regression testing

3. **Key Viewports to Test**
   - Mobile: 375x667
   - Tablet: 768x1024
   - Small Laptop: 1024x768
   - 14" Laptop: 1366x768
   - Desktop: 1920x1080

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Dynamic Content**: Test with actual API data that may have longer text
2. **Modal Dialogs**: Ensure modals are responsive and don't cause overflow
3. **Charts**: Verify Chart.js charts resize properly
4. **Forms**: Test form layouts on narrow screens

## Browser Compatibility
All fixes use standard CSS with fallbacks:
- Flexbox with wrapping for older browsers
- CSS Grid with responsive fallbacks
- Standard media queries supported by all modern browsers
