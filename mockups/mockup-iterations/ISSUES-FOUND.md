# üìã Mockup Testing Issues Report

**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Tested:** base-mockup.html and base-mockup2.html  
**Environment:** Local development (localhost:3000 + localhost:3001)

## üî¥ Critical Issues

### 1. API Call Failure - "Property address is required"
**Severity:** Critical  
**Affected:** Both mockups  
**Description:** When submitting a property address, the API returns a 400 error saying "Property address is required" even though an address was provided.

**Details:**
- Form submission sends address to API
- API endpoint: `http://localhost:3001/api/analysis/property`
- Error occurs on both manual entry and extension flow
- Retry mechanism works but all 3 attempts fail with same error

**Evidence:**
```
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request)
[ERROR] [API] Attempt 1 failed for /analysis/property: Property address is required
```

**Likely Cause:** The API is expecting `propertyAddress` in a different format or the snake_case/camelCase conversion is not working correctly.

---

### 2. TypeError: Cannot set properties of null
**Severity:** High  
**Affected:** Both mockups  
**Description:** JavaScript error occurs on page load trying to set textContent of null element.

**Details:**
- Error: `TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')`
- Function: `updateSimpleCalculator`
- Occurs immediately on page load
- Repeats multiple times

**Likely Cause:** The function is trying to update UI elements that don't exist in the DOM, possibly elements that were removed or renamed during refactoring.

---

## üü† Major Issues

### 3. Missing 404 Resource
**Severity:** Medium  
**Affected:** base-mockup.html  
**Description:** A resource fails to load with 404 error

**Details:**
- `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)`
- Happens during initial page load
- Doesn't specify which resource

**Likely Cause:** Missing CSS, JavaScript, or image file reference.

---

### 4. Extension Auto-Analyze Fails
**Severity:** Medium  
**Affected:** base-mockup.html  
**Description:** When using extension flow with `autoAnalyze=true`, the form auto-submits but fails with same API error.

**Details:**
- Extension data properly parsed and displayed
- Address correctly populated in form
- Confirmation card shows correctly
- Auto-submit triggers but API call fails

---

## üü° Minor Issues

### 5. Environment Banner Positioning
**Severity:** Low  
**Affected:** Both mockups  
**Description:** The "LOCAL DEVELOPMENT" banner appears correctly but may overlap with content on smaller screens.

---

### 6. Error Recovery UI Works But Doesn't Fix Core Issue
**Severity:** Low  
**Affected:** Both mockups  
**Description:** Error recovery UI displays correctly with Retry and Mock Data buttons, but the core API issue prevents recovery.

**Details:**
- Error UI shows appropriate error message
- Retry button attempts to retry but fails again
- Mock Data button exists but wasn't tested
- Dismiss button presumably works

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Positive Findings:
1. **Module Loading:** All JavaScript modules load correctly (mockupConfig, propertyAPI, extensionHandler, errorRecovery)
2. **Extension Data Parsing:** URL parameters from extension are correctly parsed
3. **Form Population:** Extension data correctly populates the form
4. **Confirmation Card:** Extension confirmation card displays properly with all data
5. **Error Handling:** Error recovery UI displays when errors occur
6. **Retry Logic:** API retry mechanism works (tries 3 times with delays)
7. **Environment Detection:** Correctly detects development environment
8. **CORS Configuration:** No CORS errors (localhost:3001 is properly configured)
9. **UI Elements:** All major UI elements render correctly in both mockups
10. **Console Logging:** Comprehensive logging helps with debugging

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Data Format Mismatch
The main problem appears to be a mismatch in how data is being sent to the API:

1. **Frontend sends:** 
   - Using `propertyAPI.analyzeProperty()` 
   - Converts to snake_case with `toSnakeCase()`
   - Sends as JSON body

2. **Backend expects:**
   - Field name might be different
   - Format might be different
   - Could be expecting nested structure

### Secondary Issue: DOM Element References
The `updateSimpleCalculator` function references elements that don't exist, suggesting:
- Incomplete refactoring
- Missing HTML elements
- Incorrect element IDs

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Fixes (DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET)

### Fix 1: API Data Format
- Check what exact format the Railway API expects for property address
- Verify snake_case conversion is working correctly
- Log the actual JSON being sent to the API
- Ensure the API endpoint path is correct

### Fix 2: Remove or Fix updateSimpleCalculator
- Either remove the function call if not needed
- Or add the missing DOM elements
- Or update the element IDs to match what exists

### Fix 3: Fix Missing 404 Resource
- Check browser Network tab to identify the missing resource
- Remove or fix the reference

### Fix 4: Test Mock Data Flow
- Verify the Mock Data button actually loads mock data
- Ensure mock data updates all UI sections properly

## üìä Testing Summary

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Page Load | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Loads but with JS errors |
| Form Submission | ‚ùå Failed | API error: "Property address is required" |
| Extension Flow | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Data loads but API fails |
| Error Recovery | ‚úÖ Works | UI shows but can't fix core issue |
| Test Mode | ‚úÖ Works | Banner shows, headers set |
| Module Loading | ‚úÖ Works | All modules load correctly |
| CORS | ‚úÖ Works | No CORS errors |
| UI Rendering | ‚úÖ Works | All elements render |

## üéØ Priority Order for Fixes

1. **Critical:** Fix API "Property address is required" error
2. **High:** Fix TypeError on page load
3. **Medium:** Fix 404 resource error
4. **Low:** Test and verify Mock Data functionality
5. **Low:** Enhance error recovery to handle this specific error better

---

## üìù Additional Notes

- Both mockups have identical core issues, suggesting the problem is in the shared `api-integration.js` module
- The Railway API is running and responding (returns 400, not connection error)
- The environment configuration is working correctly
- The extension handler is working perfectly for data extraction and UI updates
- The error recovery system is well-designed and functional

**Next Steps:** Fix the critical API data format issue first, then address the JavaScript errors. Once those are resolved, both mockups should work fully.
