# Checking Redis Connection Status on Railway

## Quick Check Methods

### 1. Look for Fallback Mode in STR Analysis

When you use the STR analysis feature, check the browser console or network tab for these signs:

**✅ Redis is Connected (Queue Mode):**
- Job ID format: `str-analysis-1`, `str-analysis-2`, etc.
- Progress updates: "Creating job...", "Processing...", "Complete"
- Background processing with status polling
- Results cached for 24 hours

**❌ Redis NOT Connected (Fallback Mode):**
- Job ID format: `fallback-1`, `fallback-2`, etc.
- Single status update: "Processing (this may take a moment)..."
- Synchronous processing (waits for full result)
- No caching

### 2. Check Railway Logs

In your Railway dashboard:
1. Go to your API service
2. Click on "Deployments" or "Logs"
3. Look for these messages:

**If Redis is connected:**
```
Using Redis URL from REDIS_URL
Redis connected successfully
Using Redis queue service
```

**If Redis is NOT connected:**
```
WARNING: No Redis URL found in environment
Redis not available, using fallback queue service
Using fallback processing for STR analysis
```

### 3. Test Through Browser Extension

1. Go to any Realtor.ca property listing
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Click the StarterPack extension
5. Click "Analyze Property"
6. Click "Short-Term Rental Analysis"
7. Watch the network requests:
   - Look at the response for `/api/analysis/str/analyze`
   - Check the `jobId` in the response
   - If it starts with "fallback-", Redis is not connected

## How to Connect Redis

If you see fallback mode, here's how to fix it:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
2. **Click on your API service** (not the Redis service)
3. **Go to Variables tab**
4. **Add this variable:**
   ```
   REDIS_URL = ${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}
   ```
5. **Click "Add" and then "Deploy"**
6. **Wait for deployment to complete**
7. **Test again - you should see queue mode working**

## Current Status Indicators

Based on the codebase, the system is designed to work in both modes:

- **Fallback Mode**: Fully functional, just processes synchronously
- **Queue Mode**: Better performance, background processing, caching

The fact that you're asking about this suggests the system is likely in fallback mode, which is fine for testing but should be upgraded to queue mode for production use.
