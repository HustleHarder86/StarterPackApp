## Conclusion

The StarterPackApp shows strong potential with its clean design and well-thought-out UI. The E2E test mode works perfectly, allowing efficient testing. However, the core functionality of property analysis is currently blocked by form submission issues that need immediate attention.

Once the API connection is fixed and basic user feedback mechanisms are implemented, this will be a solid tool for real estate investment analysis. The foundation is good - it just needs the critical functionality completed and some polish on the user experience.

### Overall Scores
- **Design & UI:** 9/10
- **Functionality:** 5/10 (blocked by submission issue)
- **Mobile Readiness:** 7/10
- **Error Handling:** 5/10
- **User Experience:** 7/10

**Priority:** Fix the form submission and API connection immediately to unblock the core user journey.
