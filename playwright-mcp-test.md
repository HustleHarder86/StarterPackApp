# Playwright MCP Configuration Status

## âœ… What's Working
- Playwright MCP server is installed (`@playwright/mcp`)
- All browsers are downloaded and ready (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Configuration file `.mcp.json` is properly created
- Server responds to help commands correctly

## ðŸ“‹ Configuration Details
- **Server Command**: `npx @playwright/mcp`
- **Config Location**: `/home/amy/StarterPackApp/.mcp.json`
- **Scope**: project-level configuration
- **Connection Type**: stdio

## ðŸ”§ Current Issue
The `/mcp` command shows connection issues but the server itself is functional.

## ðŸ§ª Next Steps to Test
1. Try using `/mcp` command in Claude Code CLI
2. If still failing, the server may need a brief moment to initialize
3. Alternatively, restart your Claude Code session to pick up the new configuration

## ðŸ’¡ Troubleshooting
If `/mcp` still fails:
- The MCP server is correctly configured
- All dependencies are installed
- Try restarting your Claude Code CLI session
- The server starts successfully when run directly
