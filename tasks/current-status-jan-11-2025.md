# Current Status - January 11, 2025

## Project: StarterPackApp STR Analysis Integration

### Session Summary

We successfully implemented the complete STR (Short-Term Rental) analysis system but discovered it was in the wrong architecture location. We fixed this and the system is now working with a fallback mode.

### Major Accomplishments

1. **✅ STR Analysis System Complete**
   - Integrated Apify Airbnb scraper API with cost controls (50 results max)
   - Real Toronto data working ($474/night average rates)
   - Financial calculations (ROI, cash flow, cap rate)
   - Seasonal projections and scenarios
   - LTR vs STR comparison engine

2. **✅ Regulation Compliance System**
   - Switched from OpenAI to Perplexity AI for real-time data
   - Gets current 2024-2025 regulations (not 2021 data)
   - Municipal database for Toronto, Vancouver, Mississauga, Ottawa
   - Risk assessment (high/medium/low)
   - Direct links to official licensing sites

3. **✅ Architecture Correction**
   - Moved STR analysis from Vercel → Railway API (correct location)
   - Implemented job queue system with BullMQ
   - Created fallback mode for when Redis unavailable
   - Updated all documentation with architecture warnings

4. **✅ React Components Created**
   - `STRAnalysis.jsx` - Professional analysis display
   - `ComparablesList.jsx` - Airbnb comparables grid/list view
   - `js/config.js` - Railway API endpoint configuration
   - `js/str-analysis-client.js` - Frontend API integration

### Current State

**Working:**
- ✅ STR analysis runs in fallback mode (synchronous)
- ✅ Apify API returns real Airbnb data
- ✅ Perplexity AI provides current regulations
- ✅ All calculations and comparisons work
- ✅ Job status tracking works

**Needs Completion:**
- ⚠️ Redis connection in Railway (service added but not connected)
- ⚠️ Frontend integration (load React components)
- ⚠️ Deploy final version

### Architecture Rules Established

**Railway API** (`/railway-api/`):
- ALL external API calls (Perplexity, Airbnb, OpenAI)
- Heavy processing and calculations
- Background jobs and queues
- PDF generation

**Vercel** (`/api/`):
- ONLY simple form submissions
- Static file serving
- NO external APIs
- NO heavy processing

### Environment Variables

**Working in Railway:**
```
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-*** (configured)
AIRBNB_SCRAPER_API_KEY=apify_api_*** (configured)
AIRBNB_SCRAPER_API_URL=https://api.apify.com/v2
FIREBASE_* (all configured)
```

**Needs Connection:**
```
REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}} (reference to Redis service)
```

### API Endpoints Ready

**Railway API** (https://starterpackapp-api.up.railway.app):
- `POST /api/analysis/str/analyze` - Main STR analysis
- `POST /api/analysis/str/comparables` - Get Airbnb comparables
- `POST /api/analysis/str/regulations` - Check municipal rules
- `GET /api/jobs/{jobId}/status` - Check job progress

### Next Session Tasks

1. **Connect Redis in Railway** (5 minutes)
   - Add `REDIS_URL=${{Redis.REDIS_URL}}` to API service variables
   - Restart service

2. **Load Frontend Components** (15 minutes)
   - Add to `roi-finder.html`:
     - Load `STRAnalysis.jsx` component
     - Load `ComparablesList.jsx` component
     - Add STR analysis button/trigger
     - Wire up with `str-analysis-client.js`

3. **Test Full System** (10 minutes)
   - Verify Redis queue processing
   - Test STR analysis with progress updates
   - Confirm caching works

4. **Deploy & Merge PR** (5 minutes)
   - Merge the feature branch
   - Clean up per branch policy

### Key Files Changed

**New Files:**
- `/railway-api/src/routes/analysis/str.js` - STR endpoints
- `/railway-api/src/workers/str-analysis.worker.js` - Background processing
- `/railway-api/src/services/airbnb-scraper.service.js` - Apify integration
- `/railway-api/src/utils/calculators/str.js` - STR calculations
- `/railway-api/src/utils/str-regulations.js` - Regulation checker
- `/components/STRAnalysis.jsx` - React component
- `/components/ComparablesList.jsx` - React component
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture documentation

**Removed (Wrong Location):**
- `/api/str-analysis/*` - Moved to Railway

### Success Metrics

When fully connected:
- Job IDs like `str-123` instead of `fallback-123`
- Background processing with progress bar
- 24-hour result caching
- Concurrent analysis support

### Notes for Tomorrow

1. Redis is already added to Railway, just needs variable connection
2. Fallback mode is working fine, so no rush
3. All the hard work is done - just final connections needed
4. Architecture is now correct and documented

*Session ended with working STR analysis in fallback mode. Ready for Redis connection and frontend integration.*
