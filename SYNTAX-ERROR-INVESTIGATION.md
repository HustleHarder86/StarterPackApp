# Syntax Error Investigation - roi-finder.html

## Issue Summary
When loading roi-finder.html, the browser console shows:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'
```

This error is reportedly at line 1985, which contains:
```javascript
window.cancelAnalysis = () => {
```

## Investigation Steps Taken

1. **Verified line content** - Line 1985 doesn't start with a dot
2. **Checked for non-printable characters** - None found
3. **Validated JavaScript syntax** - Module syntax is valid
4. **Tested inline event handlers** - They parse correctly
5. **Checked file encoding** - UTF-8, no issues
6. **Created test files** - Simple HTML/JS files work fine

## Key Findings

1. The error prevents ALL JavaScript from executing
2. The page structure loads but no interactive functionality works
3. The error occurs even without extension parameters
4. Moving functions between module/global scope doesn't fix it
5. The actual syntax at line 1985 appears valid

## Possible Causes

1. **Browser parsing issue** - The line number might be incorrect
2. **Module loading race condition** - ES6 modules might be interfering
3. **Hidden character or encoding issue** - Not detected by our tools
4. **Webpack/bundler artifact** - If any build process was used
5. **Extension conflict** - Browser extensions might be injecting code

## Temporary Workarounds

1. **Use the previous version** before the E2E testing changes
2. **Create a simplified version** without module scripts
3. **Debug in different browsers** to see if it's browser-specific

## Next Steps

1. Test in an incognito window with no extensions
2. Use browser DevTools debugger to set breakpoint before line 1985
3. Compare with a known working version byte-by-byte
4. Consider refactoring to avoid module scripts entirely
5. Use a JavaScript bundler to compile the code

## Impact

This error completely breaks the ROI Finder application, preventing:
- User authentication
- Property form submission  
- Analysis functionality
- Browser extension integration

The application is non-functional until this is resolved.
