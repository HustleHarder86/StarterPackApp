# Property Analysis Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed (July 21, 2025)

### 1. ✅ Property Tax Calculation Issue
**Problem**: Calculator was showing $708/month instead of $131/month for a property with $1,570 annual tax
**Root Cause**: Financial calculator wasn't receiving actual property data from the browser extension
**Fix**: 
- Updated `componentLoader.js` to use `EnhancedFinancialSummary` which properly handles property data
- Modified `InteractiveFinancialCalculator` to prioritize actual property tax data
- Fixed data flow to ensure `propertyData.propertyTaxes` is passed through the entire pipeline

### 2. ✅ View All Comparable Listings Button
**Problem**: Button did nothing when clicked
**Root Cause**: `showAllComparables()` function was just a stub with console.log
**Fix**: 
- Implemented full modal functionality in `componentLoader.js`
- Modal displays all comparables in a grid layout
- Each listing is clickable and shows all relevant data

### 3. ✅ Revenue Consistency
**Problem**: STR section showed "$5,400+ monthly revenue" but displayed "$4,596" as the actual value
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded text in the revenue potential description
**Fix**: 
- Updated `InvestmentVerdictMockup.js` to use dynamic values
- Revenue potential now shows the actual calculated monthly income

### 4. ✅ Location Hardcoding
**Problem**: Default Airbnb listings showed "King West" regardless of actual property location
**Root Cause**: Default listings in `AirbnbListingsMockup.js` had hardcoded locations
**Fix**: 
- Removed specific location references from default listings
- Updated to show "Similar Property" instead of specific neighborhoods

### 5. ✅ Data Source Labels
**Problem**: Property tax showed as "estimated" even when actual data was available
**Root Cause**: Data source determination logic wasn't checking for actual property data
**Fix**: 
- Updated `InteractiveFinancialCalculator` to properly determine data sources
- Now correctly shows "actual" when using Realtor.ca data

### 6. ⚠️ City Extraction (Railway API)
**Problem**: "Oakville" properties were searching in "Oregon" or showing as "NUE EOakville"
**Status**: Fix implemented in Railway API but needs deployment and testing
**Fix**: 
- Enhanced city extraction algorithm to handle concatenated text like "EOakville"
- Added list of known Ontario cities for better matching
- Improved regex patterns for complex addresses

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Property Tax Display**
   - [ ] Enter property with known annual tax (e.g., $1,570)
   - [ ] Verify calculator shows correct monthly amount ($131)
   - [ ] Check that data source shows "actual" not "estimated"

2. **View All Button**
   - [ ] Click "View All Comparable Listings"
   - [ ] Verify modal opens with all comparables
   - [ ] Check that listings are clickable and open Airbnb links

3. **Revenue Consistency**
   - [ ] Check STR revenue is same in all locations:
     - Investment verdict header
     - Revenue potential description
     - Financial calculator
     - Key metrics

4. **Location Accuracy**
   - [ ] Test with Oakville property
   - [ ] Verify comparables are from Oakville, not Oregon
   - [ ] Check no "King West" appears for non-King West properties
