# Chart Initialization Fix Summary

## Issue
The STR Revenue Comparison chart and Annual Revenue chart canvases were empty/blank because of a race condition where the chart initialization code was running before Chart.js was fully loaded.

## Root Cause
1. **Race Condition**: Chart modules were trying to use `new Chart()` before the Chart.js library was available in `window.Chart`
2. **Missing Check**: `strCharts.js` didn't check if Chart.js was loaded before attempting to create charts
3. **No Retry Logic**: When Chart.js wasn't available, the initialization would fail silently
4. **Missing Data Container**: The financial calculator chart expected a data container element that wasn't present

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Chart.js Availability Check in strCharts.js
```javascript
// Check if Chart.js is loaded
if (!window.Chart) {
  console.error('Chart.js not loaded yet, retrying in 500ms');
  setTimeout(() => initializeSTRChart(data), 500);
  return;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced financialCalculatorCharts.js with Retry Logic
```javascript
if (!window.Chart) {
  console.error('Chart.js not loaded yet, retrying in 500ms');
  setTimeout(() => initializeAnnualRevenueChart(), 500);
  return;
}
```

### 3. Added Robust Initialization in componentLoader.js
```javascript
// Wait for Chart.js to be available
const waitForChartJs = (retries = 10) => {
  if (window.Chart) {
    strChartsModule.initializeSTRComponents(analysisData);
  } else if (retries > 0) {
    console.log('Waiting for Chart.js to load...', retries);
    setTimeout(() => waitForChartJs(retries - 1), 200);
  } else {
    console.error('Chart.js failed to load after multiple retries');
  }
};
waitForChartJs();
```

### 4. Added Data Container for Financial Calculator
```html
<!-- Hidden data container for chart initialization -->
<div id="financial-calc-data" 
     data-annual-revenue="${annualRevenue}" 
     data-annual-expenses="${annualExpenses}"
     style="display: none;"></div>
```

### 5. Added Fallback Data Calculation
```javascript
// Calculate from current input values if data container not found
if (!dataContainer) {
  const monthlyRevenue = parseFloat(document.getElementById('monthlyRevenue')?.value) || 5400;
  const totalMonthlyExpenses = calculateTotalMonthlyExpenses() || 7576;
  annualRevenue = monthlyRevenue * 12;
  annualExpenses = totalMonthlyExpenses * 12;
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `/js/modules/strCharts.js` - Added Chart.js check and retry logic
2. `/js/modules/financialCalculatorCharts.js` - Added Chart.js check, retry logic, and fallback data calculation
3. `/js/modules/componentLoader.js` - Added robust initialization with retry mechanism for both STR and financial charts
4. `/components/calculator/EnhancedFinancialCalculator.js` - Added data container element

## Testing
Created `/tests/test-chart-initialization.html` to verify:
- Chart.js loads properly
- Charts initialize correctly with retry logic
- Charts handle delayed Chart.js loading scenarios

## Result
Charts will now:
1. Wait for Chart.js to be available before initializing
2. Retry up to 10 times with 200-500ms delays
3. Use fallback data if data containers are missing
4. Provide clear console messages about initialization status
5. Properly initialize when switching tabs or re-rendering components
