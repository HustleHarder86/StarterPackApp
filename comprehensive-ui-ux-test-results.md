## Test Configuration

```javascript
credentials: {
  email: 'amy__ali@hotmail.com',
  password: 'YFJ3-zSx'
}

property: {
  address: '123 King St W, Unit 2105, Toronto, ON M5H 1A1',
  price: '899000',
  bedrooms: '2',
  bathrooms: '2',
  squareFeet: '1100',
  propertyTaxes: '5400',
  condoFees: '650',
  propertyType: 'condo'
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Critical Issues**: Resolve Firebase configuration to enable full workflow testing
2. **Complete Testing**: Re-run tests once backend issues are resolved
3. **Mobile Testing**: Conduct dedicated mobile device testing
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Run WCAG compliance tests
5. **Performance Testing**: Measure load times and optimize

## Conclusion

The StarterPackApp shows excellent UI/UX design principles with a clean, intuitive interface. The error handling is particularly well-done, providing users with clear guidance when issues occur. However, the critical Firebase configuration error prevents the core functionality from working, which would result in a poor user experience in production. Once the backend issues are resolved, this application has the potential to provide an excellent user experience for real estate investment analysis.
