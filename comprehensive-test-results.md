## Test Results Detail



## Issues Found

No issues found during testing.

## Recommendations for Improvements

No specific recommendations. All systems performing well.

## Additional Observations

1. **Data Integrity**: Property data from the extension (e.g., "4 + 2" bedrooms) is properly parsed and calculated.
2. **City Parsing**: The system correctly handles malformed city data (e.g., "Ontario L5A1E1").
3. **Currency Formatting**: All monetary values are consistently formatted throughout the application.
4. **Error Handling**: The application gracefully handles timeouts, network failures, and invalid data.
5. **Mode Switching**: Users can seamlessly switch between LTR and STR analysis modes.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor API performance in production
2. Implement suggested optimizations
3. Add more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
4. Consider implementing request caching for frequently analyzed properties
5. Add user feedback mechanisms for long-running operations
