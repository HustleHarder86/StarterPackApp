# Production Bugs Found - January 2025

## üö® CRITICAL BUGS

### 1. Property Form Not Displaying
**Issue**: The property input form is hidden on initial page load despite authentication fallback working
- **Symptom**: Form has `display: none` even though console shows "No auth available, showing property input"
- **Location**: `roi-finder-app-fixed.js` - showPropertyInput() method
- **Fix**: The hidden class is not being properly removed from the property-input-section

### 2. Form Submission Causes Page Reload
**Issue**: Clicking "Analyze Property" reloads the page instead of making an AJAX call
- **Symptom**: URL changes to `roi-finder.html?` and all resources reload
- **Expected**: Should prevent default and make API call with loading state
- **Fix**: Form submission event handler needs to properly prevent default

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 3. Missing Autocomplete Attributes
**Issue**: Browser console warns about missing autocomplete attributes
- **Affected**: Email and password input fields
- **Fix**: Add appropriate autocomplete attributes

### 4. Tailwind CDN in Production
**Issue**: Using Tailwind CSS CDN in production (not recommended)
- **Warning**: "cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production"
- **Fix**: Build Tailwind CSS at compile time

## ‚úÖ WORKING CORRECTLY

1. **Firebase Authentication Fallback** - Properly falls back to allow access
2. **Sample Data Button** - Works perfectly
3. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Outstanding across all viewports
4. **UI/UX Design** - Professional modern design (8.5/10)
5. **Page Load Performance** - All resources load successfully

## üìä TEST RESULTS

- **Desktop View**: Sidebar layout working correctly
- **Mobile View**: Excellent responsive design with hamburger menu
- **Form Interactions**: All buttons and inputs work except main submission
- **Error Handling**: Not tested due to form submission bug

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

The property form visibility bug is preventing users from using the application. This needs to be fixed immediately as it blocks the core functionality.
