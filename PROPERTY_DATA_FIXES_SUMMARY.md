# Property Data Flow Fixes Summary

## Issue Overview
The calculator was not using actual property data from Realtor.ca listings, specifically:
- Property tax showing $708/month (estimated) instead of $3,006/year (actual) = $251/month
- HOA/Condo fees showing $450/month for a detached house (should be $0)
- Address spacing issues causing "ROADMilton" concatenation
- Airbnb comparables searching in wrong city due to parsing issues

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Railway API - Data Flow Enhancement**
**Files Modified:**
- `railway-api/src/services/property-analysis.service.js`
- `railway-api/src/utils/property-calculations.js`

**Changes:**
- Added propertyData pass-through in processResearchData to preserve actual listing values
- Enhanced calculateAccurateExpenses to prioritize actual data over estimates
- Added comprehensive logging to trace data flow
- Improved property type detection for single-family homes (no HOA fees)

### 2. **Browser Extension - Address Parsing**
**Files Modified:**
- `extension/src/content.js`
- `extension/comprehensive-extraction.js`

**Changes:**
- Fixed concatenated street types (ROADMilton → ROAD Milton)
- Added regex patterns to insert spaces between street types and city names
- Enhanced city extraction to handle complex address formats
- Improved address parsing for cases without proper comma separation

### 3. **Frontend Components - Data Mapping**
**Files Modified:**
- `components/analysis/EnhancedFinancialSummary.js`
- `components/analysis/InteractiveFinancialCalculator.js`

**Changes:**
- Updated component to check multiple locations for propertyData
- Fixed property tax and condo fee extraction from API response
- Added support for both camelCase and snake_case field names
- Enhanced property price extraction from various response structures

### 4. **City Extraction for Airbnb Search**
**Files Modified:**
- `railway-api/src/routes/analysis.js`

**Changes:**
- Expanded known cities list for better matching
- Added neighborhood-to-city mapping (e.g., Unionville → Markham)
- Enhanced city name cleanup and validation
- Fixed handling of neighborhoods in parentheses

## Data Priority System

The calculator now uses this priority for expense data:

### Property Tax:
1. **Actual from listing** (propertyData.propertyTaxes)
2. **Market data from API** (costs.property_tax_annual) 
3. **Calculated estimate** (property value × tax rate)

### HOA/Condo Fees:
1. **Actual from listing** (propertyData.condoFees)
2. **Market average** (costs.hoa_monthly)
3. **Property type based** ($0 for single-family, varies for condos)

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- Address parsing fixes work correctly
- Property type detection properly identifies single-family homes
- City extraction handles various address formats
- Property tax calculation uses correct priority
- Full data flow from extension → API → frontend → calculator

## Result

The calculator will now:
- ✅ Show actual property tax of $251/month (from $3,006/year listing data)
- ✅ Show $0 HOA fees for detached houses
- ✅ Display "actual" as data source instead of "estimated"
- ✅ Parse addresses correctly (no more "ROADMilton")
- ✅ Search for Airbnb comparables in the correct city

## Next Steps

To verify these fixes work in production:
1. Test with the live property at "33 - 1380 COSTIGAN ROAD, Milton"
2. Check that property tax shows $251/month (not $708)
3. Verify HOA fees show $0 (not $450)
4. Confirm Airbnb comparables are from Milton (not wrong area)
5. Ensure all data source indicators show "actual" where applicable
