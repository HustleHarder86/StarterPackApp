# Navigation Protection Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Navigation Protection Module
**File**: `/js/modules/navigationProtection.js`

This module provides two key features:
- **Navigation Warning**: Shows a browser confirmation dialog when users try to leave the page with active analysis data
- **External Links Handler**: Automatically ensures all external links open in new tabs

Key features:
- Listens for `analysisLoaded` and `analysisClosed` custom events
- Adds `beforeunload` event listener when analysis is active
- Processes all links on page load and when new content is added
- Adds `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links
- Adds a small arrow icon (↗) to external links for visual indication

### 2. Updated roi-finder.html
- Added import for navigation protection module (line 1454-1456)
- Added event dispatch in `renderAnalysisResults()` method (line 1125)
- Added event dispatch in `showPropertyInput()` method (line 970)

### 3. Fixed AirbnbListingsEnhanced Component
**File**: `/components/analysis/AirbnbListingsEnhanced.js`

- Changed "View on Airbnb" button to proper anchor tag with `target="_blank"`
- Added URL property to default comparables data
- Ensured all Airbnb links open in new tabs

### 4. Verified Other Components
- **AirbnbListingsMockup.js**: Already has proper `target="_blank"` attributes
- **showAllComparables modal**: Already has proper `target="_blank"` attributes

## How It Works

1. When an analysis is loaded, the page dispatches an `analysisLoaded` event
2. The navigation protection module listens for this event and adds a `beforeunload` handler
3. If users try to navigate away (except when clicking links that open in new tabs), they see a warning
4. When users return to the property input screen, an `analysisClosed` event is dispatched
5. This removes the navigation protection

## User Experience

- **External Links**: All external links (especially Airbnb comparables) now open in new tabs
- **Navigation Warning**: Users see a browser confirmation dialog if they accidentally try to leave with active analysis
- **Visual Indicators**: External links show a small arrow (↗) to indicate they open in new tabs
- **No False Warnings**: Clicking links that open in new tabs doesn't trigger the warning

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Load an analysis
2. Try to navigate away or close the tab - you should see a warning
3. Click on any Airbnb listing link - it should open in a new tab
4. Click "View all comparables" and click any listing - should open in new tab
5. Return to property input screen - no warning should appear when leaving

## Notes

- The warning message uses the browser's default text (varies by browser)
- The module uses MutationObserver to handle dynamically added content
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- No dependencies on external libraries
