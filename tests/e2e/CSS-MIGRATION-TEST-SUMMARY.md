## Visual Testing

Screenshots were captured for all pages at three viewport sizes:
- Desktop: 1920x1080
- Tablet: 768x1024  
- Mobile: 375x667

All screenshots are saved in: `/tests/e2e/screenshots/css-migration/`

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Fix roi-finder.html form visibility bug
2. Update responsive design test criteria to handle different page types

### Medium Priority
1. Set up proper API mocking or fix missing endpoints
2. Review and potentially remove !important from client-view.html print styles

### Low Priority
1. Add gradient-accent visual elements where appropriate
2. Enhance mobile navigation implementation

## Conclusion

The CSS migration has been largely successful with all pages using the unified design system. The main issues are functional (form visibility bug) and environmental (missing API endpoints) rather than CSS-related. The unified design system is working correctly and providing consistent styling across all pages.
