# STR Tab Comprehensive Test Report

## Test Summary
**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Test Type**: E2E Validation of STR (Short-Term Rental) Tab  
**Status**: ‚ùå UNABLE TO COMPLETE - Infrastructure Issues

## Test Environment Issues

### 1. Local Testing Blocked
- **Issue**: Page shows "Loading Analysis" state immediately on load
- **Cause**: Likely localStorage or session data persisting previous state
- **Impact**: Cannot access property form to begin testing flow

### 2. Automated Testing Failures
- **Puppeteer**: Navigation timeout errors (30s exceeded)
- **Playwright**: Similar timeout issues waiting for form elements
- **Root Cause**: Page state management preventing clean test runs

### 3. Deployment Access Issues
- **Primary URL**: `starterpackapp.com` - DNS resolution failed
- **Vercel URL**: `investorprops.vercel.app` - 404 errors
- **Impact**: Cannot validate production behavior

## Test Objectives (Not Completed)

### Visual Validations Required:
1. **Property Image Display**
   - Should show actual property image
   - Not default placeholder image

2. **Tab Structure**
   - Only one set of tabs should appear
   - No duplicate tab containers

3. **STR Header**
   - Clean, single header
   - No cluttered duplicate sections

4. **Revenue Comparison Chart**
   - Bar chart should render correctly
   - Compare STR vs LTR revenue

5. **STR Calculator**
   - Interactive inputs with $ symbols
   - Occupancy slider (0-100%)
   - Dynamic revenue updates

6. **Financial Calculator**
   - Annual revenue projection chart
   - Located at bottom of STR content

7. **Layout**
   - 2-column grid on desktop
   - No overlapping elements
   - Responsive on mobile

## Known Issues to Investigate

Based on recent commits and code review:

1. **Tab Switching Issue** (Commit: 67e147f)
   - Tab functionality reportedly not working
   - Need to verify fix implementation

2. **Data Visualization** (Commit: 4f55edd)
   - Enhanced charts added to LTR and Investment tabs
   - STR tab should have similar enhancements

3. **Dual-Deployment Architecture** (Commit: c87040a)
   - Vercel for fast operations
   - Railway API for heavy processing
   - Need to verify STR calculations use correct endpoint

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix Local Development Environment**
   - Clear localStorage handling on page load
   - Add query parameter to force clean state (e.g., `?clean=true`)
   - Implement proper state reset for testing

2. **Update Test Infrastructure**
   - Add explicit wait conditions for dynamic content
   - Implement retry logic for flaky elements
   - Consider using test-specific endpoints

3. **Manual Testing Required**
   - Since automated testing is blocked
   - Use browser DevTools to inspect state
   - Manually verify each validation point

### Code Review Findings:

Looking at the codebase structure:
- STR components exist in `/components/analysis/`
- Chart implementations use Chart.js
- Calculator components handle financial projections

## Test Data Used
```javascript
const testProperty = {
  street: '123 Test Street',
  city: 'Toronto',
  province: 'Ontario',
  price: 850000,
  bedrooms: 3,
  bathrooms: 2,
  sqft: 1800,
  propertyTaxes: 8500,
  condoFees: 450
};
```

## Next Steps

1. **Environment Fix**: Resolve the loading state issue preventing form access
2. **Manual Validation**: Perform manual testing with screenshots
3. **Deployment Check**: Verify correct deployment URLs and access
4. **Component Testing**: Test individual STR components in isolation
5. **Integration Tests**: Verify API endpoints return correct STR data

## Conclusion

The STR tab comprehensive test could not be completed due to infrastructure issues. The application appears to be maintaining state that prevents clean test runs. Manual intervention is required to:

1. Clear application state
2. Fix deployment access
3. Validate STR functionality manually
4. Update automated tests with proper state management

**Priority**: HIGH - STR functionality is a key feature requiring immediate validation
