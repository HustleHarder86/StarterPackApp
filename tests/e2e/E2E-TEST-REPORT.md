## üêõ Issues Found

### Critical Issues
1. **Missing LTR Tab Implementation** (Priority: CRITICAL)
   - Description: The LTR tab with interactive features is not present
   - Impact: Core feature from Option 5 is missing
   - Recommendation: Implement tab system with STR, LTR, and Investment Planning tabs

2. **Property Analysis Form Not Found** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Description: Form fields for property analysis are missing on roi-finder.html
   - Impact: Users cannot input property data for analysis
   - Expected: Address, price, property tax, square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms fields

### Medium Issues
3. **Firebase Configuration Errors** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Description: Multiple 404 errors for /api/config endpoint
   - Impact: Firebase initialization failing, may affect authentication
   - Recommendation: Ensure API endpoints are properly configured

4. **Missing Interactive Components** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Description: Rent slider, vacancy slider, and revenue comparison chart not found
   - Impact: LTR analysis features unavailable
   - Expected: Interactive sliders and Chart.js visualization

### Low Issues
5. **Missing Favicon** (Priority: LOW)
   - Description: 404 errors for favicon.ico and favicon.svg
   - Impact: Minor UX issue
   - Recommendation: Add favicon files

## üì∏ Screenshots

All screenshots saved to: `/home/amy/StarterPackApp/tests/e2e/screenshots/test-run-1753928541618/`

1. `01-homepage.png` - Homepage with gradient design
2. `02-analysis-page.png` - Login page (redirected from roi-finder.html)
3. `06-mobile-view.png` - Mobile responsive design
4. `07-tablet-view.png` - Tablet responsive design

## üîß Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Implement Tab System**: Add the STR, LTR, and Investment Planning tabs to the analysis page
2. **Add LTR Interactive Features**:
   - Rent adjustment slider (range: $0 - max based on property)
   - Vacancy rate slider (range: 0% - 50%)
   - Revenue comparison chart (Chart.js or similar)
   - Dynamic calculations based on slider values

3. **Fix Property Analysis Form**: Ensure form fields are present and accessible after authentication

4. **Resolve API Endpoints**: Fix the /api/config endpoint or update client code to handle missing config

### Testing Notes:
- The application requires proper authentication to access the analysis features
- A full Vercel development server would provide better API functionality
- The gradient design and glassmorphism effects are successfully implemented
- Mobile responsiveness is working well

## üéØ Overall Assessment

**Status**: FAIR - Core visual design implemented successfully, but critical LTR functionality missing

The gradient design update has been successfully implemented with beautiful glassmorphism effects throughout the application. However, the LTR tab with Option 5 features (interactive sliders and revenue comparison) needs to be implemented to complete the requirements.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review the LTR tab implementation code
2. Ensure tabs are properly rendered after authentication
3. Implement the missing interactive components
4. Run tests again with full Vercel development environment
