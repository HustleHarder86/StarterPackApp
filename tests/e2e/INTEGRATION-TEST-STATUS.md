# Integration Test Status

## Current State
The integration test framework has been created but encounters issues when running due to:

1. **Module Loading Conflicts**: The application uses a mix of ES6 modules and regular scripts which causes conflicts
2. **Dev Server Issues**: Vercel dev has recursive invocation problems in the test environment
3. **CORS Restrictions**: File:// protocol doesn't work due to CORS

## What The Test Would Catch

If working properly, this test would have caught:
- JavaScript syntax errors (arrow functions, export statements)
- Component loading failures
- Module initialization issues
- Runtime errors that syntax validators miss

## Files Created

1. **roi-finder-integration.spec.js** - Comprehensive Playwright test suite
2. **static-integration-test.js** - Simplified test that can run without dev server
3. **run-integration-test.js** - Test runner script

## Workaround

Currently, the best approach is to:
1. Use `npm run test:syntax` to catch syntax errors
2. Test manually in a browser with the dev server running
3. Monitor the browser console for errors

## Future Improvements

To make this test work properly:
1. Set up a proper test server configuration
2. Resolve the module loading strategy (either all ES6 or all regular scripts)
3. Create a test-specific build that doesn't have module conflicts

## Key Takeaway

While the integration test doesn't currently run due to environment issues, creating it revealed the exact type of errors we need to watch for - mixing module systems and assuming syntax validity equals runtime compatibility.
