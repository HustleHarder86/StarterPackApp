# Comprehensive Test Results & Improvement Recommendations

## Executive Summary

I've completed comprehensive testing of the property analysis tool using 3 different properties from Toronto, Oakville, and Mississauga. Below are the findings and recommendations.

## Test Properties

1. **Toronto - Tam O'Shanter Condo**
   - Address: 611 - 115 BONIS AVENUE, Toronto (Tam O'Shanter-Sullivan), Ontario M1T3S4

   - Property Taxes: $1,570/year (should show $131/month)

2. **Oakville - Queens Avenue Condo**
   - Address: 205 - 1071 QUEENS AVENUE, Oakville, Ontario L6H2R5
   - Price: $599,900
   - Property Taxes: $5,490/year (should show $458/month)

3. **Mississauga - Single Family House**
