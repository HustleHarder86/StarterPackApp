## Validation Checklist

âœ… **Functional Requirements**
- [x] Property address input and validation
- [x] API integration with Railway backend
- [x] STR revenue calculation ($9,912 displayed correctly)
- [x] LTR rental analysis
- [x] Financial calculator with mortgage calculations
- [x] Chrome extension integration
- [x] Error recovery mechanisms

âœ… **Technical Requirements**
- [x] CORS properly configured (ports 3000-3006)
- [x] Snake_case to camelCase conversion
- [x] Caching implementation (5-minute TTL)
- [x] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)

âœ… **Business Logic**
- [x] STR: Daily rate Ã— 30 Ã— Occupancy = Monthly revenue
- [x] LTR: Monthly rent Ã— 12 = Annual income
- [x] Cap Rate: (NOI / Property Value) Ã— 100
- [x] Investment Grade: Based on ROI and Cap Rate thresholds
- [x] Recommendation logic: STR if revenue > LTR Ã— 1.3
