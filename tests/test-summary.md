## 🔧 Test Infrastructure Created

### Self-Debugging Features
1. **Visual Debugger** (`tests/e2e/helpers/visual-debugger.js`)
   - Takes screenshots during test execution
   - Captures page state (elements, text, errors)
   - Self-healing selectors
   - Analyzes failures and suggests fixes

2. **Screenshot Analyzer** (`tests/e2e/screenshot-analyzer.js`)
   - Analyzes captured screenshots
   - Finds patterns in failures
   - Generates reports
   - Provides recommendations

3. **Self-Healing Tests** (`tests/e2e/self-healing-example.spec.js`)
   - Tries multiple selectors automatically
   - Captures state on failure
   - Provides detailed debugging info

## 📸 How to Use Screenshot Debugging

```bash
# Run E2E tests with screenshots
npm run test:e2e

# Analyze screenshots after test run
node tests/e2e/screenshot-analyzer.js analyze

# Generate report
node tests/e2e/screenshot-analyzer.js report

# Find patterns across multiple runs
node tests/e2e/screenshot-analyzer.js patterns
```

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Automatic Screenshot Capture**
   - Before/after each action
   - On test failure
   - With full page state

2. **Self-Healing Selectors**
   - Tries alternative selectors
   - Suggests fixes based on page content
   - Logs what worked

3. **Visual Analysis**
   - I can read the screenshots to debug issues
   - State files contain all page elements
   - Console logs are captured
