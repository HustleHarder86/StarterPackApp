# Real-Time Property Appreciation Data Options

## Current Limitations
Our current system uses hardcoded historical appreciation rates (2.8% - 7.2%) based on city and property type. This approach has limitations:
- Not responsive to current market conditions
- Can't reflect recent price changes
- No property-specific history

## Available Real-Time Data Sources

### 1. **CREA MLS® HPI (Home Price Index)**
- **What it provides**: Official Canadian benchmark prices by property type and region
- **Update frequency**: Monthly
- **Coverage**: Major markets across Canada
- **Access**: Requires CREA membership or board affiliation
- **Cost**: Varies by board, typically $500-2000/month
- **Implementation**: Would need official partnership

### 2. **Perplexity AI Integration (Recommended)**
Since you already have Perplexity API access, we can enhance it to fetch real-time data:

```javascript
// Example query to Perplexity for real-time appreciation
const appreciationQuery = `
  What is the current year-over-year property appreciation rate for 
  ${propertyType} in ${city}, ${province} as of ${currentMonth} 2024? 
  Search realtor.ca, housesigma.com, and zolo.ca market reports.
`;
```

**Pros**: 
- No additional API costs
- Already integrated
- Can access multiple sources
- Updates automatically

**Cons**: 
- Less structured data
- Requires prompt engineering

### 3. **HouseSigma API** (Semi-Official)
- **What it provides**: Historical sold prices, market trends
- **Coverage**: Ontario-focused, expanding
- **Cost**: ~$99-299/month
- **Implementation**: REST API available

### 4. **Rentals.ca Data API**
- **What it provides**: Rental market data and trends
- **Coverage**: Major Canadian cities
- **Cost**: Custom pricing
- **Use case**: Better for rental analysis

### 5. **Statistics Canada CMHC Data**
- **What it provides**: Official housing market statistics
- **Coverage**: National
- **Cost**: Free (public data)
- **Limitation**: Quarterly updates, less granular

## Recommended Implementation

### Phase 1: Enhanced Perplexity Integration (Immediate)
```javascript
export const fetchRealTimeAppreciation = async (propertyData) => {
  const { address, propertyType } = propertyData;
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/railway-api/research/appreciation', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        query: `Current ${new Date().getFullYear()} property appreciation rate for ${propertyType} in ${address}. Include:
                1. Year-over-year price change percentage
                2. 5-year average appreciation
                3. Market trend (rising/falling/stable)
                4. Data source and date
                Search: realtor.ca market reports, housesigma.com, zolo.ca, CREA statistics`,
        propertyData
      })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return parseAppreciationData(data.research);
  } catch (error) {
    // Fall back to hardcoded rates
    return getHardcodedRate(address, propertyType);
  }
};
```

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
1. Use Perplexity to fetch current market appreciation (real-time)
2. Compare with our hardcoded historical averages
3. Show both to users:
   - "Current Market: X%"
   - "20-Year Average: Y%"
   - Let users choose or average them

### Phase 3: Official API Integration (Future)
If volume justifies the cost:
1. Partner with CREA or regional boards
2. Integrate MLS® HPI data
3. Provide official benchmark pricing

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Solution | Monthly Cost | Accuracy | Implementation |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Current (Hardcoded) | $0 | Historical only | Already done |
| Enhanced Perplexity | $0 (existing) | Good | 1-2 days |
| HouseSigma API | $200 | Very Good | 1 week |
| CREA Official | $1000+ | Excellent | 2-4 weeks |

## Recommended Approach

**Start with Enhanced Perplexity Integration because:**
1. No additional cost
2. Leverages existing infrastructure
3. Can be implemented quickly
4. Provides "good enough" real-time data
5. Can validate user demand before investing in paid APIs

## Implementation Example

```javascript
// In PropertyAppreciationChart.js
const [realTimeRate, setRealTimeRate] = useState(null);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

useEffect(() => {
  fetchRealTimeAppreciation(propertyData)
    .then(data => {
      setRealTimeRate(data.currentRate);
      setIsLoading(false);
    })
    .catch(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
      // Use hardcoded rate as fallback
    });
}, [propertyData]);

// Display both rates
<div className="appreciation-rates">
  <div>Current Market: {realTimeRate || 'Loading...'}%</div>
  <div>Historical Average: {hardcodedRate}%</div>
  <div>Using: {selectedRate}% 
    <button onClick={() => setSelectedRate(realTimeRate)}>Use Current</button>
    <button onClick={() => setSelectedRate(hardcodedRate)}>Use Historical</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
