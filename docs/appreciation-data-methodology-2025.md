## Last Updated: July 24, 2025

### Overview
This document outlines the methodology and sources used to compile long-term (10+ year) appreciation data for Canadian real estate markets by property type.

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources
1. **CREA (Canadian Real Estate Association)**
   - National statistics and MLS HPI data
   - 15-year and 30-year national averages

2. **TREB (Toronto Regional Real Estate Board)**
   - GTA property type breakdowns
   - Monthly and quarterly market reports
   - 10-year appreciation data for overall market

3. **REBGV (Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver)**
   - Benchmark prices by property type
   - Historical comparison data (December 2015 baseline)
   - Sales-to-active listings ratios

4. **CREB (Calgary Real Estate Board)**
   - 10-year price comparisons (June 2015 to June 2025)
   - Property type specific data
   - 20-year CAGR calculations

5. **QPAREB (Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers)**
   - Montreal CMA statistics
   - Property type median prices
   - Year-over-year changes

### Secondary Sources
- Local real estate boards (Edmonton, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Halifax, etc.)
- Statistics Canada housing data
- CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation) reports
- Provincial real estate associations

## Data Collection Process

### Step 1: Historical Baseline Identification
- Identified available historical data points (typically 2015 for 10-year comparisons)
- Located benchmark prices where available (preferred over averages)
- Documented specific months/quarters for accurate comparisons

### Step 2: Property Type Classification
Standard property types tracked:
- **Detached/Single-Family**: Standalone homes
- **Semi-Detached**: Homes sharing one wall
- **Townhouse/Row House**: Attached multi-level homes
- **Condo/Apartment**: Strata-titled units in multi-unit buildings
- **Plex** (Montreal): 2-5 unit buildings

### Step 3: Appreciation Calculations
Where 10-year data was available:
- Total Appreciation % = ((Current Price - Historical Price) / Historical Price) Ã— 100
- Annualized Return = ((Current Price / Historical Price)^(1/Years)) - 1

### Step 4: Data Verification
- Cross-referenced multiple sources where possible
- Noted data limitations and gaps
- Identified whether data represents benchmark prices or averages

## Key Findings on Data Availability

### Complete 10-Year Data by Property Type
- **Vancouver**: Full benchmark price data from December 2015
- **Calgary**: Comprehensive data from June 2015
- **Toronto**: Overall market data with some property type specifics

### Limited Historical Data
- **Montreal**: Recent year-over-year data only
- **Smaller markets**: Primarily current pricing with limited historical breakdowns

### Data Gaps
- Many markets lack publicly available 10-15 year data broken down by property type
- Historical data often aggregated rather than segmented
- Benchmark prices not universally adopted until recent years

## Reliability Notes

### High Confidence Data Points
- Vancouver 10-year appreciation by property type (REBGV benchmarks)
- Calgary 10-year detached and condo appreciation (CREB data)
- National 15-year and 30-year averages (CREA)

### Moderate Confidence Data Points
- Toronto property type trends (mix of sources)
- Current year-over-year changes (all markets)

### Areas Requiring Professional Access
- Detailed historical MLS HPI data by property type
- Custom reports from real estate boards
- Comprehensive 15-20 year property type analysis
