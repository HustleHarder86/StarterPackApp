# StarterPack Extension Status

## Current State
The extension is properly configured and deployed. The extension-welcome.html page is live at:
`https://starterpackapp.vercel.app/extension-welcome.html`

## What We Fixed
1. ✅ Updated all InvestorProps references to StarterPack
2. ✅ Fixed all API endpoints to use starterpackapp.vercel.app
3. ✅ Added fallback for welcome page if Chrome blocks automatic tab opening
4. ✅ Added welcome state in popup for first-time users

## How to Test the Extension

### Step 1: Clean Installation
1. Remove any existing version of the extension
2. Clear Chrome cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Load the extension fresh from `/home/amy/StarterPackApp/extension/`

### Step 2: Expected Behavior
When you first install the extension:
- It will try to open the welcome page automatically
- If blocked, click the extension icon to see the welcome screen
- Click "View Setup Guide" to see the welcome page
- Or click "Continue to Login" to proceed

### Step 3: Test Core Features
1. **Test Popup**: Click extension icon → Should show StarterPack branding
2. **Test on Realtor.ca**: 
   - Go to any property listing
   - Look for "Analyze with StarterPack" button
   - Check console for "StarterPack extension loaded on Realtor.ca"

### Step 4: Verify URLs
All links should point to `starterpackapp.vercel.app`, NOT investorprops.vercel.app

## Troubleshooting
If still seeing old branding:
1. Check extension ID in chrome://extensions/
2. Navigate to Chrome's extension folder and delete old cached files
3. Restart Chrome completely
4. Load extension again

## Next Steps
The extension is ready for use. The main app integration (API endpoints) may need to be implemented separately.
