## Where the Analyze Button Appears

The "Analyze with StarterPack" button only appears on **individual property detail pages**, not on search results.

### How to use:

1. **From the search results page** (where you are now):
   - Click on any property listing (e.g., "1544 LEGER WAY")

2. **On the property detail page**:
   - Look near the **price** section
   - You'll see a blue "Analyze with StarterPack" button
   - The button has a chart icon and appears below or next to the price

3. **Click the button** to:
   - Extract property data automatically
   - Send it to StarterPack for analysis
   - View comprehensive ROI calculations

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the button on a property detail page:
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Wait 1-2 seconds for it to load
3. Check that you're on a property detail page (URL should contain `/real-estate/`)

## Supported Property Types

The extension works on all Realtor.ca property types:
- Houses
- Condos
- Townhouses
- Apartments
- Any MLS listing

The button will automatically appear on any valid property detail page!
